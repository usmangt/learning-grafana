## 3. Installation via the official repository

### Getting the GPG Key

1. Download the GPG key:

    ```bash
    wget -q -O gpg.key https://rpm.grafana.com/gpg.key
    ```

1. Import the key:

    ```bash
    rpm --import gpg.key
    ```

### Creating the repository on the machine

1. Create a new file e.g. `grafana.repo` in the `(/etc/yum.repos.d/)` directory :

    ```bash
    touch /etc/yum.repos.d/grafana.repo
    ```

2. Paste the following lines to it:

    ```bash
    [grafana]
    name=grafana
    baseurl=https://rpm.grafana.com
    repo_gpgcheck=1
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=https://rpm.grafana.com/gpg.key
    sslverify=1
    sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

    # to avoid installing any beta release add this line
    exclude=*beta*
    ```

### Download and install Grafana

Run the following command to download and install the Grafana package:

```bash
yum install grafana
```

> **Note:**  If you are using RHEL/CentOS 8 or higher then use the `dnf` command instead of `yum`.

# Configuring System services

1. To start the Grafana service so that be able to use it, run the command:

    ```bash
    systemctl start grafana-server
    ```

1. Check the status if it is active or not via command:

    ```bash
    systemctl status grafana-server
    ```

    The output will look similar to this:

    ```bash
    ‚óè grafana-server.service - Grafana instance
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/grafana-server.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
    Active: active (running) since Fri 2023-07-28 11:38:15 CEST; 6s ago
    ```

    Here it does states that the service is `active (running)` which confirms that we can now access Grafana.

1. Enable the Grafana service to load automatically when the system boots:

   ```bash
    systemctl enable grafana-server
    ```

# Accessing Grafana

## Login via Web UI

1. To access the Grafana UI on the web browser, type the IP along with the port `3000`. For example: ```192.168.122.144:3000```

1. The Grafana sign-in page appears.

1. To sign in to Grafana, enter `admin` for both the username and password.

# Troubleshooting

## Verifying via cURL

Run a curl command to verify whether a given connection should be working in a browser under ideal circumstances.

```bash
curl 192.168.122.144:3000
```

The following example output determines that an endpoint has been located.

```bash
<a href="/login">Found</a>
```

> **Note:**  If you encounter problems in accessing the WebUI then please check the logs for troubleshooting. The default location is `/var/log/grafana/grafana.log`.
> 
> Also make sure that the port `3000` is not blocked by a Firewall.

## Checking log file

1. The default location of grafana log file is `(/var/log/grafana)` directory.
   
   ```bash
   cd /var/log/grafana
   ```

1. Inside there you will find the `grafana.log` file which contains all the logs when having issues e.g. failed to startup or unexpected crash etc. To view it use the command:

   ```bash
   less grafana.log
   ```
